Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard


Project Overview:
This project focuses on building an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales data from a fictitious coffee shop in New York City. 
The dataset includes over 149,000 transaction records, which were explored using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Excel formulas to derive 
insights into sales performance over time, by product category, and by store location.

Technologies Used:
Excel: PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Data Cleaning.

Insights & Recommendations:
- Sales increased consistently from January to June. The highest revenue was recorded in June with $54,445.69, and the lowest in February with $25,320.05. The business should focus on maintaining or improving this growth trend by introducing promotions or seasonal offerings, especially in the slower months like January and February.
- Transaction volume is fairly stable throughout the week, but Monday has the highest number of transactions and Sunday has the lowest. The business may want to target Sunday with special offers or events to boost sales, while Monday might already be benefiting from workweek routines, making it a day worth maintaining current marketing efforts.
- Peak sales hours are around 9 AM and 10 AM. Focus on staffing and inventory during the morning rush hours. Additionally, the business could introduce breakfast-specific promotions to capitalize on the high volume.
- The Barista Espresso is the top-selling product, both in terms of transaction count and revenue. Other top performers include Gourmet brewed coffee and Brewed Chai. The coffee shop should prioritize stocking these high-demand items, and consider bundling them with complementary products like pastries or scones to boost sales further.
- Coffee and Tea are the most popular product categories, followed by Bakery items. These categories are central to the coffee shopâ€™s business. Given the popularity of coffee and tea, the shop could expand offerings in these categories, such as introducing new flavors to attract more customers.
